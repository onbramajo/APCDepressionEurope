# APCDepressionEurope
Code and Materials to An Age-Period-Cohort Approach to Analyse Late-Life Depression Prevalence in Six European Countries, 2004â€“2016.

Some parts of the wrangling were done in Stata because the data was provided in .dta form and back in the day I wasn't 100% skilled to do the merging that way (so the data is already cleaned up ready for analysis. However the paper explains clearly the logic and procedure). Also the part of the analysis of deviance was done by excel, but I am happy to discuss and the paper explains the logic (to calculate the contribution of each AD, APC and AP model to reduction of deviance when compared to an single Age factor model)
